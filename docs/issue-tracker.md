# Issue tracker: Live answer defects

One list of known defects, so that each fix is weighed against the whole. Evidence comes from saved Live records
(`artifacts/live/`) unless a row says otherwise.
- **Priority:** P1 means the user's question goes unanswered or answered wrongly; P2 means the answer is right but hard
  to read or trust; P3 is a known, bounded limitation.
- **Paid checks:** a paid Live check runs after a meaningful group of fixes, not after each PR. Until then a fix is
  verified offline only.

## Open

| ID | Area | Concrete example | Priority | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I-1 | **Direct, complete answers** | **(a)** F04 (live check 2026-09-29) asked "Was Directlink being out of service what drove the NSW1 price spike…?": the answer lists correct observations and hedged possibilities but never says what the evidence supports. **(b)** W19 (held-out v4) does not say the reserve (LOR) forecasts were cancelled before the day, and its hypotheses lean on them | P1 | **(a): fixed offline** in `fix/causal-question-direct-answer` (below), **Live unverified**. **(b): open** |
| I-2 | **Evidence selection and calculations** | **(a)** F04 never fetched the other regions' prices, so it misses that VIC1, SA1 and TAS1 were also above 470 $/MWh while QLD1 was about 65. **(b)** W04 gives both total-demand values (10046.72 and 11432.7 MW) but not the rise between them: a derived number has no evidence ID | P1 | open |
| I-3 | **Clear presentation** | F01 shows "New South Wales 150" without "MW". F03 shows "1630 hrs" without its zone (NEM time, 06:30 UTC). Headlines are vague or off the question: F03's after repair, F04's (the peak price) | P2 | open |
| I-4 | **Internal details in user-facing text** | Tool names (W20: "API functions named get_actual_demand / get_forecast_runs"), controller notes ("Market notices were not searched…" on document questions, F01), and evidence IDs (F04: "ev0878 … is not a time-stamped observation") | P2 | open |
| I-5 | **Known safety-language limitations** | See the list below. Each is recorded with its risk. None is being worked on, to avoid an open-ended wording cycle | P3 | recorded; revisit only with a new concrete failure |

### I-1a: F04, the causal question not answered directly

**Root cause.** From the saved record `artifacts/live/live-check-2026-09-29/F04.json` and trace `tr-0417e1209f13`:
1. **Recognition.** The controller's test for "does something a market notice reports explain the event?"
   (`asks_if_notice_event_caused`) needs a causal word and an incident word. "drove" matched. "being out of service"
   matched no incident word, so no notice timing was computed and none was required.
2. **Conclusion.** Where the test does fire, the controller computes each notice's time against the event, and the
   answer must state that timing. Nothing turns the timing into what it supports. Saved answers state the timing and
   stop:
   - H13 and W19 lead with the peak price;
   - W18 says the outage was "after the price extreme" without concluding;
   - F04's first draft led with the peak price and put "records do not establish a causal relationship" only among
     the uncertainties.

**The evidence F04 had.** The Directlink notice gives 0700 hrs 27/07 (the outage began), 1700 hrs 31/07 (scheduled
end) and 1430 hrs 31/07 (return). The price extreme was the interval ending 07:30 AEST on 31/07. So the outage was in
effect at the extreme. Timing does not rule it out, and no retrieved record shows whether it was behind the price.
That is insufficient evidence, not a timing contradiction.

**Acceptance check** (offline, written before the code change):
1. F04's question is recognised as asking whether a notice-reported incident explains the event.
2. Replaying F04's saved tool calls and first draft, the displayed summary opens with a sentence built from the
   evidence:
   - it names the notice by what the question names (Directlink);
   - it gives the notice's earliest time with its zone and UTC, and says it is before the price extreme;
   - it says the timing does not rule it out, and that no retrieved record shows whether it was behind the price.
   - The answer passes validation with no fallback and no causal wording, and says nothing about the Avon–Marulan
     notice, which the question does not ask about.
3. A timing contradiction reads differently. Replaying W18 (the Hazelwood bus-tie outage at 11:00 AEST, after the 09:10
   price extreme), the opening sentence says timing rules it out.
4. There is no generic sentence:
   - non-causal event questions (W01, W02, W03, W16) are unchanged;
   - a causal question whose incident is in no retrieved notice gets no inserted sentence.
5. The Replay evaluation and the safety suite are unchanged.

### I-5: safety-language limitations (recorded, not being fixed)

| Example | Where | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "It has been approved." "The case note got the green light." "Case note ✅ approved." "Approved and published." | approval-claim check (#13) matches wording | Low: no write is possible (tool allowlist, approval boundary); a misleading claim could be shown |
| "Wind, not demand, caused the spike." "Demand was not unusual and wind causes such spikes." "The report about the trip says wind caused the spike." | caveat causal check, clause scoping (#14) | Low–medium: an unsupported cause could stay in a caveat |
| "…is to blame", "…is behind the spike", "It was the wind." | causal wording outside `CAUSAL_RE`, narrative and caveats | Medium: an unsupported cause in any displayed text |
| Hypothesis tests (`what_would_test_it`, shown in the app), citation `supports` notes and numeric-claim `text` (API output only) | no language check reads these fields | Low–medium: injection echo or causal wording could be shown there |
| A quote that starts inside a word ("scheduled wind/solar…" inside "non-scheduled") | quote check (substring match) | Low: a negating prefix can be dropped from a verbatim quote |
| Instruction text phrased so that `INJECTION_RE` misses it | the index-time flag (#12) and the echo check | Medium: an unflagged injected passage could be cited or echoed |
